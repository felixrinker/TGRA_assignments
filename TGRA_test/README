Task:

1.	Make a windowed desktop application that displays a box. 
	Make the box move at an even speed diagonally.
	If the box hits the edges of the window, make it change direction as if it's bouncing.
	If it hits the top of the screen, only change the up-down direction and so on.
2.	Make a windowed desktop application that displays a box.
	Make the box move around the screen when you hold down the arrow keys.
	Dont let it exit the screen.
	When it hits the edge make it stop.3.	Make a windowed desktop application that displays a blank screen.
	When you click with the mouse on the screen display a box centered at the point you clicked on.
	Each time you click the screen add a new box.
	Every frame you have to display all the boxes, so you have to keep track of them the whole time.
	Use if(Gdx.input.justTouched()) so you only create one box for each click.You can do this in three projects or one project with three starter classes or maybe the simplest way is 
to do it all in one program with all the functionally combines, one moving box, 
one input box (different color) and then a box for each click too. 
Pack all the projects into a single archive (zip or rar) and return through the course website.
